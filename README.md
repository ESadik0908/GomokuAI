# GomokuAI
 A minimax algorithm to play the game of Gomoku.

This was made as part of my AI module for my 3rd year of university alongside one of my classmates. The assignment required us to code a Gomoku AI that would receive a Gomoku board with tiles placed on it and return an x, y coordinate for the move we want to play. As the game controller code was written by the university I am unable to distribute it so the code provided is just the AI that we produced. As we were required to make a move within 5 seconds of receiving the board we were not able to explore the minimax algorithm with a larger depth or breadth. The AI were then put against each other in a round Robin tournament and out of ~30 teams our AI came joint 7th with the top 10 teams only being separated by about 10 points (2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw).
